# patent-q
These data provide estimates of patent q and the replacement cost of patent capital, which is used to construct patent q. Patent q was developed in my paper, Woeppel, Michael, 2022. Using Patent Capital to Estimate Tobinâ€™s q. Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 57(8), pp. 2929-2967. The data in my paper span 1976 through 2019. These data span 1950 through 2024. 

If you use these data, please cite my paper as the data source.

These data span 1950 through 2024 (updated March 9, 2025) and include patent q and the replacement cost of patent capital for firms in Compustat. As described in the above mentioned paper, the replacement cost of patent capital is a function of estimated patent values (which are used in my JAE paper and available upon request). Although estimates of patent capital linked to Compustat firms begin in 1950, estimated patent values begin in 1926. Patent capital, along with the market value of capital, the replacement cost of physical capital, and on-balance sheet intangible capital, is used to construct patent q. I plan on updating these data on an annual basis.
